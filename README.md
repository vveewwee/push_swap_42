# push_swap

### About push_swap 
A sorting program, receiving integers in the standard entry and prints out a series of operations in order to sort the numbers.
Optimization is the first priority, with the limitation of having only certain operations available.

## Algorithm
For this project, i created my own sorting algorithm, a combination of sorting, fusion and quick in recursivity. The mix-algo was optimized for the 100 argumetns sorting but not for the 500. So for the advanced sorting, i implemented another algo, that sorts by pieces.
Although the bonus is easy to make (a checker of the operations), you must have completed the first part with 100%.
